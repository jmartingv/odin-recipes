                <ul>
                    <li>Leave the soup as it is, with the vegetable chunks, or</li>
                    <li>Blend the soup. If you choose to do so, <strong>remove the bay leaf first</strong>.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>After blending (or not), your soup will be ready. Enjoy!</li>
